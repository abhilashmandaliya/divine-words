MIRROR

#### Poem

WHEN YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT IN YOUR STRUGGLE FOR SELF

AND THE WORLD MAKES YOU KING FOR A DAY ,

JUST GO TO A MIRROR AND LOOK AT YOURSELF

AND SEE WHAT THAT MAN HAS TO SAY .

 

FOR , IT IS NOT YOUR FATHER OR MOTHER OR WIFE

WHO JUDGEMENT UPON YOU MUST PASS ;

THE FELLOW WHOSE VERDICT COUNT MOST IN YOUR LIFE

IS THE ONE STARING BACK FROM THE GLASS .

 

SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK YOU A STRAIGHT-SHOOTIN ' CHUM

AND CALL YOU A WONDERFUL GUY ,

BUT THE MAN IN THE GLASS SAYS YOU ARE ONLY A SCUM

IF YOU CAN ' T LOOK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE .

 

HE IS THE FELLOW TO PLEASE , NEVER MIND THE GAPING REST ,

FOR HE IS WITH YOU CLEAR UP TO THE END .

AND YOU HAVE PASSED YOUR MOST DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT TEST

IF THE MAN IN THE GLASS IS YOUR FRIEND .

 

YOU MAY FOOL THE WHOLE WORLD DOWN THE PATHWAY OF LIFE

AND GET PATS ON YOUR BACK AS YOU PASS ,

BUT , YOUR FINAL REWARD WILL BE HEARTACHESAND GEARS

IF YOU HAVE CHEATED THE MAN IN THE GLASS .

 

                                           SWAMI   KRISHNANANDJI
